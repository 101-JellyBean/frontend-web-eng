Welcome to my repo for Web Engineering. Here we will be building a front end for this [Movie api](https://webeng-rug.github.io/Tutorials/#/).

## Comming soon

Take a look in the branches for a peak in the future.

* slides
* tutorial steps/ planning

## How to run

1. Start [this](https://github.com/WebEng-RUG/Tutorials) backend from Floris Westerman

2. You should have the backend running on `localhost:3001` and `localhost:3002` 

   > These are the default settings
   >
   > We need both because there some issues with both versions
   
3. make sure everything is installed with `npm ci`

4. run in the root `npm run dev`

3. You should now get an url in the terminal where your hot-reload svelte instance is running.
